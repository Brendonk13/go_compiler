* Our compiler must be built with OCaml version 4.07.0 with menhir installed through Ocaml's package manager: opam.

* Must use opam to install the Str library used for regex in src/gen_name_maker.ml

* Codegen will not run without the environment variable: GOLITEGROUP11 set to the output of pwd command, pwd must be executed in the same directory as this README.md. Run command: export GOLITEGROUP11=\`pwd\`

* Our generated code can be found in the generated directory which has directories: programs, programs-solutions which must have the same directory structure as the corresponding directories in the root folder of this project.
